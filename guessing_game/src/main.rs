    //Sure thing! we are accessing the rand library and within it the 
    //thread_rng() which is a local number generator, and with that 
    //local number generator we can use the gen_range function to generate
    //a number between 1(inclusive) and 101(exclusive), we want the user to
    //guess a number between 1-100, so that's why we did so!

    //for some kind of error handling message

    //we are comparing guess # and secret # and matching them to the "arms"
    //of the possisble results of this result:which returns us Ordering,an enum

    match guess_number.cmp(&secret_number) {

    //when we compile here, we are getting a mismatch error for comparison,
    //because we are trying to compare an int(secret_number) to
    //our guess number(technically a string) so we must do some type conversion:

    //trim() removes the whitespace because when we press ENTER on ourkeyboard
    //the input becomes [input value] \n. .parse() allows us to parse it into 
    //our declare type we want, in our case, an unsigned integer 32bit.
    //This is quite nice to work with not so large, positive numbers!!@_@

    //but the .parse() can also fail, which returns a RESULT of sorts.
    //as such we can do an expect...
    //BUT can we do better? If the user inputeted an invalid guess "number",
    //then all we'll get it a message say ing something went wrong. Instead,
    //what if we just made them keep asking for a number until they give us
    //a right one? HERE is where MATCH comes to the rescue. The MATCH can return
    //something that it went OK or that there was an error: So we can match:
    }
